                                </li>
                                <li>Data Collection Fee: Every Wizard that is created shall incur the Data Collection
                                    Fee.
                                </li>
                                <li>Execution Fee: The execution of any Plan that generates internet traffic shall
                                    incur the Execution Fee. If the Plan also incurs a Data Collection Fee, then the
                                    Execution Fee shall be wavered;
                                </li>
                                <li>Consultation Fee: From time to time additional support (referred to as Consultation)
                                    may be required in the use of Services and the development of the Website Materials.
                                    The Consultation Fee procures a day's worth (8 hours) of Consultation. Any
                                    Consultation done shall consume the Consultation Day on a half hour basis, such that
                                    a Consultation Day can remain in credit to the Client in part over a period of time.
                                    The commissioning of a Consultant Day shall be agreed to with the Client ahead of
                                    the provisioning of the same. The Consultation Fee is subject to change prior to the
                                    commissioning thereof. Malbec is under no obligation to justify or itemize the
                                    consumption of Consultant Days. Upon Termination of this Agreement, any outstanding
                                    credit in terms of Consultation Days is non-refundable and non-transferable;
                                </li>
                                <li>Provisioning Fee: The initial provisioning of Services shall incur a setup Fee;
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Should the Client use the Services in any way that results in costs imposed on Malbec, that
                            exceed the variable Fees, then Malbec can pass those costs onto the Client as Excessive Use
                            Fees;
                        </li>
                        <li> The Client will be invoiced on a monthly basis;
                        </li>
                        <li>Fees in relation to the Services shall commence from the Commencement Date specified in the
                            Order Form subject to the conditions laid out in this Agreement. If the Services commence
                            partway through a month, Malbec will reduce the Fees for that month on a pro-rata
                            basis;
                        </li>
                        <li>The Client will provide Malbec with complete and accurate billing and contact
                            information during the terms of the Agreement;
                        </li>
                        <li>If the Client reasonably and in good faith disputes an invoice or part of it, the Client
                            shall notify Malbec of the dispute within 7 days of receipt of the disputed invoice,
                            including details of why the invoiced amount is incorrect and, if possible, how much the
                            Client considers is due. The Client will pay all undisputed Fees by their due date;
                        </li>
                        <li>All Malbec invoices are to be paid by the Client through Direct Debit. Malbec will
                            present the Client with a completed Direct Debit Mandate as part of the Agreement. The
                            Client agrees to cooperate with Malbec to facilitate payment through Direct Debit.
                            Payments made in any other manner than through Direct Debit, shall remain at the
                            discretion of Malbec. Where payment of amounts invoiced through Direct Debit has not
                            taken place for any reason then the Client must make alternative arrangements to make
                            payment within 5 Business Days;
                        </li>
                        <li>All payments required to be made pursuant to the Agreement by the Client shall be made
                            in Pounds Sterling GBP (or such other currency as agreed between the Parties) in cleared
                            funds to such bank as Malbec may from time to time nominate, without any set-off,
                            withholding or deduction except such amount (if any) of tax as Malbec is required to
                            deduct or withhold by law;
                        </li>
                        <li> Where any payment pursuant to the Agreement is required to be made on a day that is not
                            a Business Day, it may be deferred to the nearest Business Day;
                        </li>
                        <li>Without prejudice to sub-Clause 12.2.1 of these Terms and Conditions, any sums which
                            remain unpaid following the date on which they were due for payment shall incur interest
                            on a daily basis at 8% per annum above the base rate of the Bank of England from time to
                            time until payment is made in full of any such outstanding sums.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Client may not cancel their payment obligations and the Client is not entitled to a
                            refund of Fees paid to Malbec.
                        </li>
                        <li>Without prejudice to the provisions of clause 5.2 of these Terms and Conditions, Malbec
                            shall, upon providing no less than 90 days’ notice (the "Fees Increase Notice"), be
                            entitled to increase the Fees payable by the Client. If no Fees Increase Notice is given
                            to the Client, the Agreement will continue on the same pricing as that of the previous
                            Term. The fee increase must not take effect within the Initial Term. The Fees Increase
                            Notice must inform the Client:
                            <ol>
                                <li>of their right to terminate the contract pursuant to either of (i) clause 12.5
                                    of these Terms and Conditions (as a result of receipt of the Fees Increase
                                    Notice), or (ii) clause 12.1 (on not less than ninety days notice);
                                </li>
                                <li>of the date of expiry of the present Term; and</li>
                                <li> that if the Agreement is not terminated then it will automatically renew upon
                                    the expiry of the present Term for a further Term of 12 months pursuant to
                                    clause 12.1.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Each Party shall:
                            <ol>
                                <li>keep, or procure that there are kept, such records and books of accounts, as are
                                    necessary to enable the amount of any sums payable pursuant to the Agreement to
                                    be accurately calculated;
                                </li>
                                <li>at the reasonable request of the other Party, allow that Party or its agent to
                                    inspect those records and books of accounts and, to the extent that they relate
                                    to the calculation of those sums, to take copies of them.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>Suspension of the Services
                    <ol>
                        <li> Without limiting any rights under this Agreement and without any liability to the
                            Client, Malbec may suspend the Services if the Client either:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Cancels its Direct Debit instruction for payment of the Fees; or</li>
                                <li>Defaults on its payment obligations of Fees; or</li>
                                <li>if Malbec reasonably believes that the Client is in breach of the Agreement or
                                    is likely to be in breach of the Agreement while Malbec investigates the
                                    suspected breach. Any investigation will be carried out promptly and the Client
                                    agrees to cooperate with Malbec in connection with any such investigation.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>If, following suspension of the Services, the Client makes payment of the Fees due and
                            the Client sets up a new Direct Debit instruction for payment of Fees, Malbec will
                            resume provision of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the Services will not be
                            resumed where the Agreement has terminated under Clause 12 of these Terms and
                            Conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Where Malbec suspends the Services due to non-payment of Fees, the Client must pay a
                            reinstatement fee of £250.00.
                        </li>
                        <li> Malbec can suspend or restrict the Service to carry out necessary planned maintenance
                            services or during any technical failure of the Services, where it is necessary to
                            protect the security of the Services or the data or Malbec’s systems, provided that in
                            each case, Malbec will aim to keep all service suspensions to a minimum. Malbec shall
                            endeavour to give the Client at least 8 hours’ prior notice of any planned maintenance.
                        </li>
                        <li>Any suspension of the Services will not affect the Client’s obligation to pay the Fees
                            due during any period of suspension.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Liability, Indemnity and Insurance
                    <ol>
                        <li>Malbec shall ensure that it has in place at all times suitable and valid insurance that
                            shall include public liability insurance.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the event that Malbec fails to perform the Services with reasonable care and skill,
                            it shall carry out any and all necessary remedial action at no additional cost to the
                            Client.
                        </li>
                        <li>The total liability of Malbec to the Client under the Agreement in respect of all claims
                            in any year shall be limited to the aggregate amount of Fees paid by the Client for that
                            calendar year.
                        </li>
                        <li>Malbec shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by the Client that results
                            from the Client’s failure to comply with any instructions given by Malbec or for any
                            error, inaccuracy or omission in the output of the Services based on any inaccurate or
                            incomplete information which the Client has provided to Malbec.
                        </li>
                        <li>To the extent permitted by law, Malbec shall not be liable to the Client (or any party
                            claiming through the Client) in contract (including under an indemnity), tort, breach of
                            statutory duty or otherwise for any:
                            <ol>
                                <li>loss of profits, opportunity, revenue, data, goodwill, business or anticipated
                                    savings, pure economic loss, loss of value of equipment, or expectation loss; or
                                </li>
                                <li>any indirect, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary loss or damage, even
                                    if such loss or damage was reasonably foreseeable, arose naturally or was in the
                                    contemplation of the Parties, resulting from access to the Services or any
                                    interruption to access to the Services.
                                </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>The Client shall indemnify Malbec against any costs, liability, damages, loss, claims or
                            proceedings arising from loss or damage to any equipment, Malbec Materials or Malbec
                            Technology (including that belonging to any third parties appointed by Malbec), caused
                            by the Client or its agents or employees.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Client shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Malbec against claims, actions,
                            proceedings, losses, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation court
                            costs and reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with the Client’s use
                            of the Services and/or Documentation, provided that in case of any such claim:
                            <ol>
                                <li>the Client is given prompt notice of any such claim;</li>
                                <li>Malbec provides reasonable co-operation to the Client in the defence and
                                    settlement of such claim, at the Client’s expense; and
                                </li>
                                <li>the Client is given sole authority to defend or settle the claim.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Malbec shall not be liable to the Client or be deemed to be in breach of the Agreement,
                            by reason of any delay in performing, or any failure to perform its obligations if the
                            delay or failure is due to any cause beyond Malbec’s reasonable control, including the
                            actions of third party suppliers to Malbec or defects in the products or services so
                            supplied to Malbec, equipment failure, or changes to third party operating systems, web
                            browsers or other software used by Malbec or the Client in providing, accessing or
                            interfacing with, the Services.

                        <li>Nothing in these Terms and Conditions nor in the Agreement as a whole shall limit or

                            Malbec.

                <li>Remedy of defects

                                    breach and requires the breach to be remedied;
                                </li>
                                <li>an encumbrancer takes possession, or where the Client is a company, a receiver

                                    therefrom, effectively agrees to be bound by or assume the obligations imposed
                                    on the Client under the Agreement);

                                    thereto by Sections 1124 and 1122 respectively of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.

                            which leads to Malbec having the right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to clause
                            12.2 of these Terms and Conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the purposes of sub-Clause 12.2.2, a breach shall be considered capable of remedy if
