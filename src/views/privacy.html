            <h1 class="section-title">The data we collect about you</h1>

            <p>"Personal data", or "personal information", means any information about an individual from which that
                person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous
                data).</p>

            <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and
                you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or
                are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you services). In this case, we may have

            <h1 class="section-title">How we use your personal data</h1>


            <ol>
                We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. We may only use your data for
                specific
                purposes. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
                <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with
                    you.

            <p>Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in
                relation to analysing results of surveys or sending third party marketing communications to you via
                email or text message. However, occasionally we may need to share your data with our employees or
                partners outside the UK/EEA in performance of our contractual obligations to you, our general legal
                obligations or for our legitimate purposes, including financing. By consenting to use our services,
                you consent to the transfer of your data to such individuals or companies for a limited purpose in

                we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you services). In this case,

            <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around
                marketing and advertising.</p>

            <p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think
                you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which services and
                offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
            </p>

            <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or
                purchased services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or
                registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that
                marketing.</p>

            <p>We will secure your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company
                outside Malbec Limited for marketing purposes.</p>

            <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by sending us an
                email on support@maximillian-workflows.com or logging into our maximillian-workflows.com website and
                checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences. Alternatively, you can
                adjust your marketing preferences by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to
                you or by contacting us at any time. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this
                will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a service purchase, service experience
                or other transactions.</p>

            <p>At no point will we ever share personal data you have registered under a Client account with another
                Client. If you happen to register with multiple Clients on our platform, then you are for all purposes
                multiple separate identities, and need to process any related privacy issues separately.</p>

            <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in
                accordance with the law.</p>

            <p>We may occasionally need to share your data with our group companies, employees, partners or
                providers, such as accountants or lenders, who are based outside the EEA, as specified in paragraph
                4 above. This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and the
                UK where existing laws do not provide the same level of protection for the security of your personal
                data. For example, your consent to the transfer of your personal data to the third parties may be
                implied whenever you provide your data, which makes your personal data vulnerable to misuse. By
                consenting to use our Services, you consent to the transfer of your data to such individuals or
                companies for a limited purpose in performance of our contractual obligations or in pursuit of our
                legitimate interests. However, we require all involved parties to respect the security of your
                personal data and to treat it in accordance with principles of confidentiality.</p>
            <p>You have the right to withdraw consent to the data transfer outside the UK and the EEA at any time by
                following sending us an email on support@maximillian-workflows.com. Please, note that if you
                withdraw your consent to the transfer of your data outside the UK/EEA, we may not be able to perform
                the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you services). In
                this case, we may have to cancel a service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the
                case at the time.</p>
            <p>Please, note that our surveys are currently processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and

            <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
                accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we
                limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties
                who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and
                they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. </p>
            <p> We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you

                it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
                requirements.</p>
            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
                your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
            <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial
                and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax and legal purposes.</p>
            <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further
                information.</p>
            <p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated
                with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information

            <p>Maximillian Workflows provides a platform for our Clients to collect data from their Customers. We
                encourage you, as a Customer, to make every effort to contact the Client before reverting to us, as
                our Clients understand you and your data and are in a much greater position to address and mitigate
                any concerns you may have. Infact we make every effort not to interpret the data we hold on the Clients'
                behalf, in accord with the principle that your private data is indeed private.</p>
            <p>If you still wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at
                support@maximillian-workflows.com.</p>
            <p>Please also note that you, as a Customer, might be the Customer of potentially more than one of our
                Clients. In these circumstances you have one identity for each Client with which you are registered. If
                you wish to exercise any of your rights listed above, you must identify which identity belonging to
                which Client you wish to affect. We never share Customer data between Clients, and so will never reveal
                your other identities not specifically under the domain of a specific Client.</p>
            <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
                excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. </p>
            <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
                right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
                measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
                We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
                our response.</p>
            <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
                than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
                case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
