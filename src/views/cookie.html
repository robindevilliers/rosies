            <h1 class="section-title">Client cookies</h1>
            <p>Maximillian Workflows hosts websites for Clients. We also host websites as subdomains underneath our
                standard domain name, as in abc.maximillian-workflows.com for a hypothetical company called ABC. These
                are not Maximillian Workflows assets and are not covered by our Cookie Policies etc. These are our
                Client websites and they will have their own policies which you can view linked off their websites.
                These websites will not carry our trademarks.</p>
